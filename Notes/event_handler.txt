Node.js has a built-in module, called "Events"
it allows us to wire up custom events to our own obj and then emit those events at a later point in time.
where you can create-, fire-, and listen for- your own events.
assign event handlers to our own events with the EventEmitter object.
to fire an event-emit()
var eventEmitter=new events.EventEmitter(); //creating new event emitter object
