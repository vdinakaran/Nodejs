Streams are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in continuous fashion.
In Node.js, there are four types of streams −
Readable − read operation.
Writable −write operation.
Duplex −for both read and write operation.

piping
-----------
Piping is a mechanism where we provide the output of one stream as the input to another stream


chaining
-------------
to connect the output of one stream to another stream and create a chain of multiple stream operations.
It is normally used with piping operations.
